            Kyoto is the heart of the Japanese tea ceremony tradition. The art
            of tea-making, influenced by Zen Buddhism, involves preparing and
            serving matcha (powdered green tea) with great care and respect for
            aesthetics. Kyoto has several historic teahouses, like those in the
            Gion district, where you can experience traditional tea ceremonies.

            Kyoto is known for its Geisha (or Geiko) and Maiko (apprentice
            Geisha) culture, especially in the historic Gion district. Geishas
            are highly skilled in traditional Japanese arts such as dance,
            music, and conversation. The presence of Geishas and Maikos in Kyoto
            symbolizes Japanese elegance, and tourists can often spot them
            walking along the streets in beautiful kimono.
